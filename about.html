		<h2>About me.</h2>

		<p class="aboutMe">
			<b>My name is Dylan Myers, and welcome to my website.</b>
			<br>

		  This is the first version of something I threw together before I graduated college.<br>
			I have a degree in Computer Engineering from Florida International University.<br>
			I was a software engineering intern at JPMorgan Chase & Co. last summer.<br>
			I am interested in photography (check out my VSCO), and programming.<br>
			Some of my programming projects cover topics such as Machine Learning, Autonomy, and backend development.
			Thank you for visiting my page.
